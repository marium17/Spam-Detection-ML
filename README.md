# 📬 Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to classify messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using two popular machine learning algorithms:

- 🧠 **Naive Bayes Classifier**
- 💡 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

The models were trained on a small set of example messages and tested with new user inputs. The SVM model also includes a visual representation using a decision boundary in 2D TF-IDF space.
